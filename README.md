# BlackjackProject

## Description
	- Create a Blackjack game with a dealer & a player
	- Create a deck of cards with cards that have a suit & value
	- Start the game & deal cards to the player & dealer
	- Ask the player to hit or stand with the cards they have in their hand
	- Automate the dealer to hit or stand based off of the cards in their hand
	- Announce a Blackjack, bust, win, or loss

## Technologies Used
	- Java
	- Eclipse
	- Sublime
	- Git/GitHub
	- MacOS Terminal

## Lessons Learned
	- Always commit your work so that it saves
	- Learned how to write & call several methods, which represented different actions
	- Learned to have two entities (player & dealer) use the same player class
	- Learned .equalsIgnoreCase & try/catch

## Changes Made
	- Refined User Experience with verbiage and formatting
	- 
	 
## Difficulties Encountered
	- The player class with different actions for both the player and the dealer
	  was difficult to figure out & I am sure that I still could have done it better
	- It was difficult to conceptualize EVERY action of both players & to know what
	  methods to construct and where to call them.
	- I added, deleted, & added back several actions/methods as I tried to figure out
	  who was doing what. I had several redundant methods & I tried re-naming several 
	  things to better grasp what was actually happening.
